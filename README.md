This analysis provided the green light for a full-scale site migration, transforming "lost traffic" into "engaged customers" and ensuring marketing expenditure was no longer being wasted on a leaking funnel.

### Project excerpt
An analytical deep dive into landing page performance using A/B testing to reduce a 60% bounce rate and drive higher user engagement for a leading online toy retailer.

### Project description

The Website Manager at Fuzzy Factory identified a critical friction point: the homepage was experiencing an unusually high bounce rate of 60%. To address this, a new landing page (/lander-1) was developed to capture user interest better and guide them further into the purchase funnel.

The Process Using Excel for data manipulation and statistical validation, I executed the following workflow:
* Traffic Segmentation: Filtered website traffic to isolate the specific segment involved in the experiment.
* Performance Metrics: Calculated the bounce rates for both the control group (/home) and the test group (/lander-1).
* Statistical Validation: Performed a two-proportion Z-test to determine if the observed 5% improvement was due to the new design or mere chance.

#### The Results
The analysis revealed a statistically significant improvement. With a 95% confidence interval (ranging from 2.2% to 8.0% lift), we confirmed that the new landing page successfully reduced bounce rates. 
My recommendation to the management team was to fully transition to the new design, as the data proved it would lead to higher session retention and, ultimately, increased sales opportunities.
